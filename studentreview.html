            <h1>GOWTHAM GM</h1>
A warm thanks to the Tap Academy team.<br>
I am Gowtham GM from Tamilnadu, a 2024 passed-out student. I joined <br>Tap Academy as a CSR student in the month of February. My journey <br>with Tap Academy is quite different. The trainers at Tap Academy are <br>skilled and experienced. They teach a lot of new concepts and help in<br> learning programming languages from scratch.<br><br>

<br>
I am from the Computer Science branch, but the teaching at Tap Academy is structured in a way that makes it easy for students from all domains to understand the concepts and technology taught by the trainers.<br><br>

Finally, I got placed as a Software Engineer at Revature with a package of 3.25 LPA. The placement team helped me a lot in securing this job.<br><br>

Thank you to the entire Tap Academy team for helping me acquire this opportunity.

            <h1>Gagan GR</h1>
        <p>After joining Tap Academy, I have improved my programming skills, and <br>my knowledge of core Java has also improved. Now, I am learning the <br>Collection Framework, MySQL, HTML, and CSS in parallel.<br><br>

            Through the TAI platform, I have enhanced my problem-solving skills. <br>Additionally, the LMS makes it easy to watch all the recorded videos. <br>They also provide recorded videos of frameworks like J2EE, Spring, <br>Data Structures, etc.<br><br>
            
            I got placed in Promantia Business Solutions for the role of Associate<br>Technical Consultant with a package of 3 LPA.
            
            Thank you TAP ACADEMY for giving me this opportunity.</p>
